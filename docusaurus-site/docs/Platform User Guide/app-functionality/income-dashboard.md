title: Income Dashboard
slug: /income-dashboard

Use **Income** in the sidebar to review rent income across the portfolio.
The dashboard requires both Invoices View and Leases View. Without Leases View, income is
**Unavailable**. If loading your permissions fails, select **Retry**.

The dashboard summarizes scheduled monthly rent, expected income after overdue balances, and the total overdue
balance for active and notice-period leases. The income tables also include scheduled leases and their saved invoice
schedule, so you can review upcoming charges before a lease begins. Unpaid invoices due in the future are marked
**Upcoming**. Scheduled leases without saved invoices do not appear as invoice rows.

Use the search field to find income records by property, unit, or lease status.

Select **Filters** to show income for a single unit. Only units with a scheduled, active, or notice-period lease are listed,
under their property, so units with the same name in different properties stay distinct. The summary totals and the
table update to the selected unit, and the filter is kept in the page address as `unitId`, so a link such as
`/income?unitId=12` opens the dashboard already filtered. Select **Clear Filters** to return to the full portfolio;
your search and grouping stay as they were.

## Manual Invoices

Select **New Invoice** to add a charge for an existing lease. Choose the property, unit, and lease term; the linked
tenant is filled in automatically. With Invoices Create, you can create an invoice even when
Tenants View is denied: the tenant field displays **Unavailable**, and the invoice uses the lease's
linked tenant. When no tenant is supplied, Parcelis uses the tenant added to the lease earliest,
with the lowest tenant ID breaking ties. For individual billing, only that tenant receives the invoice.
Select **Add item** to choose a configured charge or **Custom item**. A configured
charge fills in its default description, with `{month}` and `{year}` filled from the due date; a custom item lets you
enter its name. You can edit the description for this
invoice. The form shows the subtotal, paid amount, and balance due before the invoice is created. Manage reusable
item names and descriptions in
**Settings → Invoicing**. Saved invoices keep a copy of the item and description as entered.

If you change any field or add a charge line, closing the drawer with **X**, **Cancel**, an outside click, or **Escape**
shows **Your changes will not be saved.** Select **Keep Editing** to retain all entered values, or **Discard** to close
the drawer and clear the form. Pressing **Escape** in the confirmation also keeps your edits. An untouched form, or
one returned to its initial values, closes without a warning.

The drawer stays open while invoice creation is in progress. A successful save closes and clears it; if creation
fails, your values remain available to edit or retry, and closing still requires confirmation.

## Manage an Invoice

Select an invoice identifier to open its details. The property rail groups invoices by property and unit, making it
easy to move between related invoices.

Use **Edit invoice** to change the due date or charge lines. You can add and remove charge lines, but an invoice
always requires at least one line. The edit form shows the existing paid amount and balance so you can review the
effect of the changes before saving.

Use **Record payment** to add the first payment, or **Add payment** when the invoice already has a payment. A fully
paid invoice is marked **PAID**; invoices with a remaining balance are shown as open, overdue, or partially paid as
appropriate. Use **Add note** to attach internal notes to the invoice. **Delete** permanently removes an invoice and
its charge lines. Delete is disabled for invoices with payment history, including invoices whose
payments have all been reversed. Hover over **Delete** or move keyboard focus to the button
to see a tooltip explaining why deletion is unavailable. Reversing a payment preserves its history and does not make
the invoice eligible for deletion.

## Income by Unit

Income is grouped by unit by default. Each group is labeled with the unit and property, followed by the total invoice
amount, amount paid, and remaining balance. Select a unit row to expand its scheduled, active, and notice-period
leases, including all lease tenants and invoice details. Select an invoice row to open that invoice's details.

Expanded rows show the invoice ID, due date, status, amount, balance, and payment details when payments have been
recorded.

Select the **Grouped By Unit** toggle to switch to an ungrouped rent-roll view. This lists each lease with its property,
unit, lease status, scheduled rent, and overdue amount.
